Data Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates various data visualization techniques using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The notebook utilizes the BAC.csv dataset to generate insightful charts and graphs, helping to understand different visualization methods.

Overview
This notebook covers multiple types of visualizations to explore and analyze data effectively.

Graph Types Included:
ðŸ“Œ Scatter Plot â€“ Examines relationships between two numerical variables.
ðŸ“Œ Bar Plot â€“ Compares categorical data using bars.
ðŸ“Œ Histogram â€“ Displays data distribution over a range.
ðŸ“Œ Displot â€“ Provides detailed distribution visualization.
ðŸ“Œ Joint Plot â€“ Combines scatter and histogram for deeper analysis.
ðŸ“Œ Pair Plot â€“ Shows relationships between multiple numerical columns.
ðŸ“Œ Box Plot â€“ Highlights median, quartiles, and outliers in a dataset.
ðŸ“Œ Catplot â€“ Specialized for categorical data representation.
